This is a port of Qt based C++ code that allow draw rounded polygons.
[Read this blog.](https://www.toptal.com/c-plus-plus/rounded-corners-bezier-curves-qpainter)
It usfull for drawing UI controls.
That project uses Microsoft .NET Framework Windows Forms that not have quadric bezier curves.
But in Wikipedia we find formula that convert quadric bezier curve points to
cubic bezier curve points used in Windows Forms.
Use RoundPolygon class from that VS2008 project.
